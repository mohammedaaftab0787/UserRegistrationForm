# UserRegistrationForm
📋 I had a task to do:  👨‍💻 I made a form for a website. It asks for your Name, Email, Password, Date of Birth, and more.  🔒 I also added a thing to show how strong your password is.  📸 You can even upload a picture!  ✅ And there's a box you check to agree to the rules.  📂 I put it on GitHub. You can take a look!
